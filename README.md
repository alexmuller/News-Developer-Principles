# BBC News Developer Principles

Our culture is the sum of all of our attitudes and actions. Having a good culture requires that we all set the best example we can for each other. This document lists the core principles we aspire to in our engineering culture.

## We encourage learning

We value learning, community and trust. We try to work with each other as openly and collaboratively as possible.

 * Everyone's skillset and capacity for learning is different. We don't disregard a person because they don't understand a subject. We cater for different levels of understanding among our colleagues.

 * We are open about what we know and understand. The knowledge we collectively use in our jobs is too much for one person. Rather than hiding our unfamiliarity with a subject we ask for help or clarification.

 * We learn what we can about all the different codebases, systems and tooling that the team uses on a daily basis. While we don't expect to know everything we do try to learn how things work, and we factor time for learning into our estimates for tasks.

 * We help each other to learn, and don't store knowledge for ourselves. When we learn something new we document our findings to help others get up to speed and offer help to our colleagues.

## We strive to be as objective as possible

People are complicated. We expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others. When this occurs we resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame, and we try not to take offense where no offense was intended. We give each other the benefit of the doubt.

 * We are open to alternative ways of thinking.
 * We are more interested in the right solution for our team than an individual opinion.
 * Technology moves fast and we embrace change.

We don't do things, "because that's how we've always done it". And while skepticism is healthy, it must always be friendly. Our assertions should be backed up with evidence as much as possible.

## We take performance really seriously

Performance is a key feature of our code, and it is a requirement that underpins all our work.

 * We consider how every change impacts on performance.
 * We value user convenience over developer convenience.

For example we would not choose a new code library or technique which offers us convenience at the expense of the user's experience.

## We practice test driven development

We value high quality code, refactoring and bug free production environments.  A test driven development approach enables this.

 * We write tests for all code that goes to production. Our codebases are large and complex. Tests help ensure that we aren't breaking things.

 * Our prototypes do not make their way to production. While its completely legitimate to create prototypes to explore our ideas or solutions, once we've worked out how to make something we go back and make that the code is robust and production ready. This means adding unit or integration tests and making sure the work satisfies security and performance requirements. We do not cut corners to reach deadlines.

 * Developers test their own code thoroughly, ensuring their code works on all the devices and clients we support. Our testers and developers work collaboratively to determine the appropriate coverage and methodology for test automation. Both testers and developers fully test code manually, with the tester being the second pair of eyes.

## We value automation as much as possible

Automated process saves time and avoids unintended errors.  We encourage developers to spend time learning how to automate because it also exposes us to different kinds of development.  We respect our developers by giving them the responsibility to own their own processes.

 * We want developers to have a deep understanding of the tools, workflows, and responsibilities that go into producing production ready software.

 * We continually push to automate as much as possible. Fix the process as well as the product.

## We all collectively own everything the team creates

Building a good code infrastructure involves the work of the team, not an individual who feels like the sole proprietor of a project. Collective ownership gives us all the opportunity to train and learn, and helps individual team members avoid becoming burdened by being the only one who knows some specific thing.

 * Collaboration is key

 * We work towards common conventions and embrace debate

 * We continually improve the way we do things

 * We expect and embrace disruption

## We value all of our users

This is for everyone. Accessible design is good design. Everything we build should be as inclusive as possible. We’re building things for the whole country not just elite users.

 * We recognise that the people who most need our services are often the people who find them hardest to use. We think about those people from the start.

 * We create accessible, legible experiences.

 * We adhere to the highest quality accessibility conventions as a priority.

 * We always put user convenience above developer convenience.

 * Making something look simple is easy. Making something simple to use is much harder, especially when the underlying systems are complex, but that’s what we always attempt to do.

## We value the benefits of the Linux and "Open Source" principles 

We try to share as much as possible what we're doing with the rest of the development community. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. Much of what we’re doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the broader community. We should pay that back.

 * We favour small, single purpose programs over monolithic structures.

 * We benefit from the open source community so we contribute to the open source community as much as possible.

 * We help developers to progress their career by using open source projects to build individual profiles outside of the company.
